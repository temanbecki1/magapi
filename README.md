# magapi

Given a CSV file of user information, build out an API with the following reqs:

[] Endpoint to return specific user
[] Endpoint to return a list of users between a date range
[] Endpoint to return a list of users based on specific profession
[] Custom Endpoint of my choosing

What did I like about this project?
This project allowed me to refresh parsing csv files in Javascript. As I am consistently working to improve my development skills, I tend to stick to a particular stack and practice writing applications to retain information. With that being said, I chose to use Javascript, Prisma, PostgreSQL for the project at hand. As I write a lot of microservices in Java, I decided to see if I could push myself to write a functioning api with minimum documentation as I was on a flight writing most of this code. It was extremely fun! I also learned a few things about prisma ORM as well.

There wasn't anything I didn't like about the project.

The project gives enough information to begin development. There were not many clarifying questions needed.

With this project, I simply created GET routes for this particular server. However, I also have create/update/delete endpoints that I would further fill out this api. I was going to implement those, however I wanted to add authentication so that not everyone would be able to add/update/delete and I ran out of time. This was actually fun! It also gave me content for my YouTube channel as I teach others to code!
